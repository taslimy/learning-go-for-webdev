# Learning Go for Web Dev.
### Purpose
Gave up find a job doing html,css,js,node,react. So learning something new and maybe it pays off.

## Go Compiling
- *go run filename.go* compiles and immediately runs Go Programs.
- *go build filename.go* complaies a bunch of Go source files and it complies packages and dependencies. If you run *go build* it will complite the files in the current directory and will produce an executable file with the name of the current working directory.
- *go build -o app* will produce an ececutable file called app.
